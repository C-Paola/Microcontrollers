This is a compilation of codes made during the microcontrollers course. Each one of them is properly documented line by line in **Spanish**. This repository includes codes for:

- 7 Segment display.
- LCD.
- Matrix keyboard, EEPROM and PWM.
- Graphic LCD.
- Timer 0.
- Timer 1 and 2.
- Analog to digital converter.
- CCP module.
- Communications.

Each one of them is located in a folder. For further explanation contact the authors.

# Requirements
Make sure you have a ``` PIC16F877A ``` microcontroller, its pin layout is described in the following image:

[INSERT PIC]

# Running the code
To run the code you need to compile it using software, in this case we used "PIC C Compiler" software, and to burn the program into the microcontroller we used PIC burner, use the reference you prefer.
